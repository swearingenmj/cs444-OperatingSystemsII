# Project 5 Starting the File System

## Introduction

We're going to implement a Very, Very Simple File System (VVSFS).

It's going to have a structure similar to what was described in the exploration, and we're going to continue implementation over the next several weeks.

This week's goals are to write code to:
- Create the file for holding the simulated file system.
- Read a block.
- Write a block.
- Find a free data block.
- Mark a data block as free or not-free.
- Find a free inode.
- Mark an inode as free or not-free.
- Write the first version the file system to disk.
- Write tests to verify everything is working.

It is strongly suggested you read this entire file in order one time, then go through it again in order during implementation.
